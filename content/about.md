# Hi there

My name is 0xm4g1c, and Iâ€™ve started this blog to give me a space to jot down my thoughts, and aggregate all the knowledge i come across.

My aim overall is to educate and learn more myself about where technology and privacy meet, and am deeply enthusiastic about the ability to secure technologies and grant people to take back control of their data, and more broadly, their digital lives.

I am a security engineer by day, but have fallen down the Startup and cryptocurrency rabbit holes as of late and will be focusing my posts on all three topics. I post about things I do or explore in the various fields of Computer Security. The content i write can be found in the blog's section of this site.
